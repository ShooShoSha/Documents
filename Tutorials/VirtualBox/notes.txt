Installing
Before clicking on anything, be sure to read prompts licenses, warnings, et cetera
Download from site [3]
Run installer
-Double click file
--Security prompt, click "Run"
-Using command prompt or powershell
--Navigate to directory or Shift+Right-click in directory select "Open command window here"
--Begin typing name of file (use Tab for auto-completion)
---Possible file name: 'VirtualBox-X.X.X-X-Win.exe', where x is positive integer
---Pressing Tab multiple times will cycle through possibilities
--*This usually bypasses security warnings, so be careful with this method
-Click "Next >"

The next screen allows customizations. Here you can decide which features to include in the installation. Some 
customizations:
-Whether to include a feature or not
-Specify a location where that feature will be installed
--In other words, you specify every feature to be in its own directory on any drive (including network or external)
--*Would not recommend doing this, but it is available

The "Disk Usage" button shows which drive(s) the features will be installed on, how much disk space is required, what 
the resulting available space will be after installation, and will highlight drives that do not have enough space for 
the feature to be installed. If you specified different drives by mistake there are three (3) options you may take:
-1. Change the directory again (if you want the default see step 3)
-2. Create the directory you want (it only searches for directories that are all ready on the drive)
-3. Exit the installer and try again.

After all the customizations for the features, there will be more customizations about the install itself. They are:
-1. Create a shortcut on the desktop
--This will place a shortcut icon on your desktop for more immediate access
--Will not check this because I like to keep my desktop clean.
-2. Create a shortcut in the Quick Launch Bar
--This places an icon in the taskbar for single-click launching
--Will keep checked
-3. Register file associations
--
By default, they are all checked.
