Installing
Before clicking on anything, be sure to read prompts licenses, warnings, et cetera
Download from site [3]
Run installer
-Double click file
--Security prompt, click "Run"
-Using command prompt or powershell
--Navigate to directory or Shift+Right-click in directory select "Open command window here"
--Begin typing name of file (use Tab for auto-completion)
---Possible file name: 'VirtualBox-X.X.X-X-Win.exe', where x is positive integer
---Pressing Tab multiple times will cycle through possibilities
--*This usually bypasses security warnings, so be careful with this method
-Click "Next >"

The next screen allows customizations. Here you can decide which features to include in the installation. Some 
customizations:
-Whether to include a feature or not
-Specify a location where that feature will be installed
--In other words, you specify every feature to be in its own directory on any drive (including network or external)
--*Would not recommend doing this, but it is available

The "Disk Usage" button shows which drive(s) the features will be installed on, how much disk space is required, what 
the resulting available space will be after installation, and will highlight drives that do not have enough space for 
the feature to be installed. If you specified different drives by mistake there are three (3) options you may take:
-1. Change the directory again (if you want the default see step 3)
-2. Create the directory you want (it only searches for directories that are all ready on the drive)
-3. Exit the installer and try again.

Once done with the features customizations and disk usages, click "Next >"

After all the customizations for the features, there will be more customizations about the install itself. By default, 
they are all checked. They are:
-1. Create a shortcut on the desktop
--This will place a shortcut icon on your desktop for more immediate access
--Will not check this because I like to keep my desktop clean.
-2. Create a shortcut in the Quick Launch Bar
--This places an icon in the taskbar for single-click launching
--Will keep checked.
-3. Register file associations
--This will update the system's registry files so that all VB files are associated with VB
--Will keep checked so we do not have to manually do so later.
Click "Next >" to continue

If the network feature was selected for installation, the next screen will warn you about installing a network driver. 
This installs a driver to use the network card installed so that your virtual machines can connect to the internet. 
During its installation, it will reset the connection (temporarily) disconnecting you from the network (LAN, WAN, WiFi,
etc.).

If you are performing a task over the network (e.g. downloading files, streaming music, uploading files, playing a 
game, etc.), finish those tasks or put them on pause. Crazy errors will happen if they are in the middle of something. 
Usually you may just have to re-do it. Click "Yes" if you are ready.

Now that all the customizations for the installation are finished, now is the time for installation. Here we can 
"Cancel" the entire process, go "< Back" to change a customization, or "Install". For myself, the installation part
took about thirty (30) seconds to finish.

When you are successful, there is an option to launch right away when you click "Finish".
