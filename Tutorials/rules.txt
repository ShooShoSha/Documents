sound quality is important, perhaps the most important aspect of any tutorial video
dont show your mug. the video is about the subject matter, not you
every tutorial should be independent of any other. if there are prequistes, BRIEFLY review them and link to more information or other tutorials.
never improvise. plan out your tutorial, even for problems that may occur (this includes jokes, stand-ups do this you should too)
preempt problems to the furthest extent possible. the fewer questions asked, more time saved
define your terminology before hand. if you use abbreviations (abbrv.), define and relate to the abbrv. and the term
assume your quality will look bad wherever it is displayed. if text is displayed, zoom in on it for clarity or cite it elsewhere for clearer viewing
cite all your references. plagarism is intellectual genocide. do not be a idea murderer
avoid copyright infringements. make original content, use royalty free material, content in the public domain, or acquire licenses (spend a few dollars to avoid lawsuits of ponds of dollars)
