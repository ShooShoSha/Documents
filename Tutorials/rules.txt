sound quality is important, perhaps the most important aspect of any tutorial video
dont show your mug. the video is about the subject matter, not you
every tutorial should be independent of any other. if there are prequistes, BRIEFLY review them and link to more information or other tutorials.
never improvise. plan out your tutorial, even for problems that may occur (this includes jokes, stand-ups do this you should too)
preempt problems to the furthest extent possible. the fewer questions asked, more time saved
